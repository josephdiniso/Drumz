# Drumz - Virtual Drum Simulator
### Authors: Joseph DiNiso, Enzo Saba, Steven Shaumadine
## How to run:
1. Install required Python packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. If not yet installed, install ffmpeg: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
3. Enter the directory `application` and run the program with `python3 main.py`
4. Select the audio files to use - the number of audio files may be either four or five.

## How to play:
1. Get two markers with distinct colors on them, blue and green tend to work well. Press the space key and hold the markers on the two outer circles, holding them there until the clock counts down from three. Repeat this process again, holding the markers in the inner two circles. If done correctly the color inside the four circles should match the color of the markers you are holding.
2. Press space to enter the simulation mode, there should be four colored squares on the bottom of the screen, these represent each of the drums that you have. When your marker collides with one of the squares, a sound is made. The harder you hit the higher the pitch and the louder the sound.
